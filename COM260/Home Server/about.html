				<p>My server is a bit on the older side. It is a Dell XPS workstation that I received from my Uncle who was cleaning out his old computers.
				<br><br>It contains:
					<ul>
						<li>Intel i7 930</li>
						<li>22GB RAM (it is a random conglomeration of <br>DDR3 RAM across 6 channels</li>
						<li>16TB theoretical storage running RAID 5 (10TB actual) </li>

				<p>For as long as I can remember, my family has always been big on movies. Therefore we have a lot of DVDs. We have a ton of movies and TV shows.
				In today's modern world, DVDs are dying, and digital is taking over. Since we have so many, it is easier and cheaper to convert what we have to digital,
				and then upload it to a server that can be accessed anywhere so long as an internet connection is available. For the longest time, this server was strictly media,
				but then my friend's Minecraft server was unable to keep running due to hardware issues. So I offered mine, and now I am running both a Minecraft and Terraria server
				in addition to all my media.
